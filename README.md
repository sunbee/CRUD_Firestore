# Use Firestore Backend-as-a-Service from Google
## Firestore is a fully-managed NoSQL database and storage bucket with associated services including serverless functions. This repo has boilerplate for CRUD on Firestore.

What to use this notebook to source boilerplate Python code for:
- CRUD operations on Firestore NoSQL database
- Firestore advanced queries and indexing
- CRUD operations on Firestore storage bucket, etc.

Use-case I have in mind is a digital twin of my paper-trail. I'd like to search and retrieve documennts with tags. The tags arise from:
- manual tagging
- machine-extracted with OCR
- machine-generated tags with AI and computer vision
